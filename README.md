# Zendesk Private Comment App

Zendesk Labs used to publish a private comment app that let you make
private comments on a ticket you were editing. Now they charge money
for the privilege.

Given this app is really just 5 lines of code, we figured why make it
expensive.

### The following information is displayed:
